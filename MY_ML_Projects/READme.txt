I'm Mahendran D.I started to learn Data Analytics through NPTEL in my first year of B.tech.Due to covid,
after one year break I wrote Data Analytics with python and got 92% among top 2% of that course.
Based on that I done mini-project Heart prediction using ensemble learning technique.I have practiced many algorithms of Machine Learning and do some courses and practices
I uploaded my practise notebooks and simple projects. I done one project throught IBM Collaboration through my college with deployment through flask.
I worked as a annotater in Frinls Technologies Delhi for 2 months as a intern.
